 *  <p>Factory pattern days that just define an Interface or abstract class for creating an object but 
 *  let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate. In other words, subclasses are responsible to create the instance of the class.
 *  <h3> Usage of factory pattern</h3></p>
 * <ul><li> 
 *  When a class doesn't know what sub-classes will be required to create
 *  </li><li>When a class wants that its sub-classes specify the objects to be created.
 *  </li><li>When the parent classes choose the creation of objects to its sub-classes. 
 *</li><ul>
